# Black-Jack ♠️♣️♥️♦️
I pinned this for memory purpose as yhis is my first Python project :)

From here, I made two versions, which both are different on rules.

The first one is the simple version, where user fights against other players, while dealer is responsible for distribuing and checking cards to find the winner. No chips are involved, winner who gets 21 or the cloest to 21 would be winner of the game.

The second one is decided for multi-users in playing in the program (friends), where chips system are involved, user can formulate betting strategies with the betting system. Each new round requires user to pay 50 chips to join the game. Player does not have enough fee or gets 0 chip will be fouled. The last survivor is the final winner of the game.

Since this was mainly text-oriented game. In order to making it more interesting and attractive, I would attempt to visualize it in other platform or module.
